      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist who is passionate about supporting adults, teens, couples, and families. I strive to create a safe space using warmth, humor, and unconditional positive regard where clients can be their true, authentic selves.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Originally from the Bay Area, I completed my undergraduate studies at Tufts University in Boston and worked in finance before shifting life paths and moving to South America. After 5 years working with both non-government organizations and the Colombian public school system, I returned to the United States and completed a dual master’s degree in Marriage Family Therapy and School Counseling from St. Mary’s College of California.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I take a person-centered, non-judge mental approach to meet my clients exactly where they are at. I believe that you, the client, are the expert of your experiences. I work alongside you in partnership drawing from Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Solutions Focused, Motivational Interviewing, Existential, and Internal Family Systems (IFS) to co-create healing and growth. I have extensive experience supporting trauma, anxiety, depression, attachment wounds, and life transitions across a mosaic of populations. I look forward to working with you!</p>

          <h3 class="service-title">Anxiety</h3>
          <p>We ruminate about what went wrong in the past and worry about the uncertainty of what has yet to come. This can make us cranky, distracted, distant, and exhausted, getting in the way of work, school, and our most important relationships. I work with you to break the shackles of negative thought patterns and eliminate the uncertainty associated with future events so you can spend more time living in the moment of the here and now.</p>

          <h3 class="service-title">Depression</h3>
          <p>Depression has a variety of forms. You might be feeling sad, alone, or hopeless. Perhaps you are feeling numb, tired, or having a hard time concentrating on daily tasks. Maybe you are just feeling stuck and confused. We can explore reasons why you might be feeling this way and discuss how to start feeling more like your true self.</p>

          <h3 class="service-title">Trauma</h3>
          <p>Traumatic experiences can become stuck within our nervous system, affecting our ability to sleep, remember, emotionally regulate, and communicate effectively. We’ll work together to build a safe container to process your experiences, identify areas in your life that are currently being impacted by traumatic experiences, and we’ll practice and strengthen skills to improve your ability to regulate and thrive.</p>

          <h3 class="service-title">Life/Work Transitions</h3>
          <p>Getting engaged? Recent divorce? Contemplating a career change? Welcoming a new member into the family? Life transitions represent inflection points that come with their own unique set of stressors. We can discuss any past, present, or future concerns that might be coming up during these transitions.</p>

          <h3 class="service-title">Couples' Therapy</h3>
          <p>Couples’ therapy works at any stage of the relationship. Maybe you are just starting in a relationship and want to establish clear family goals and communication strategies. Perhaps you have been having the same argument over and over and are noticing that resentment is starting to build towards your partner. You might have even decided to end the relationship together but want to finish on amicable terms. I utilize an Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) approach where we build empathy for one another and strengthen our ability to communicate about vulnerable and important topics. I even work with teen and young adult couples!</p>

          <p>New school? New friends? New romantic relationships? New values? Our teenage years are when we see an explosion of social development… and that can be overwhelming! From test anxiety to relationship turmoil, I’ll work with you to identify where you are succeeding and where we can develop and strengthen new skills for growth. Teenagers continue to be some of my favorite people to work with and I hold a dual degree in school counseling.</p>
